**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football game, effectively managing the roles of attack and defense along with a balanced midfield play is crucial. Distinguishing the players based on their primary tasks such as ball handling and shooting (attack), and regaining possession and defense can greatly simplify the learning process and increase effectiveness. The midfield role, in this smaller team setup, can be combined partially with both attack and defense dynamics. Thus, deciding to split into two groups where one focuses on aspects of handling and attacking while the other focuses on aspects of defense and transitioning play (moving from defense to attack, commonly involving passes and positioning) will provide comprehensive coverage of the core skills required in a football game.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** Focused on offensive skills; this group will aim to learn effective ball control, dribbling, and shooting capabilities. Training will focus on the use of 'Dribble', 'Stop-Dribble', and 'Shot' actions. The group will also work on positioning to receive the ball in advantageous spots, which involves learning to use various movement actions strategically.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** Concentrated on defensive skills and transitioning play. The three players will learn to effectively dispossess opponents using 'Sliding', master positioning to intercept passes, and regain possession. Moreover, the group will be essential in learning how to transition from defense to attack using 'Short Pass', 'Long Pass', and mastering appropriate movements to receive or disrupt passes. These players should also learn to manage 'Sprint' and 'Stop-Sprint' for rapidly changing their position based on game dynamics.
