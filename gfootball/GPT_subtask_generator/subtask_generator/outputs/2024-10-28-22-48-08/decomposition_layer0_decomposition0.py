**Analyse:**
In a football match, there are typically different roles assigned to players to ensure the team's success, such as defenders, midfielders, and forwards. These roles have specific responsibilities, including defending, controlling the midfield, and attacking. Given this, we can divide the 5 agents into two groups based on these roles.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** Develop skills for midfield control and playmaking

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** Enhance skills for defending and goalkeeping

In football, midfielders play a crucial role in controlling the game, linking defense to attack, and creating scoring opportunities. Hence, Group 1 will consist of 3 agents tasked with learning skills related to passing, dribbling, and strategic positioning to dominate the midfield and create scoring chances.

On the other hand, defenders and goalkeepers are responsible for thwarting the opponent's attacks, ensuring the safety of their own goal, and initiating counterattacks. Therefore, Group 2, composed of 2 agents, will focus on defensive skills such as intercepting passes, blocking shots, and clearing the ball effectively to maintain a solid defensive line and protect the goal.

By dividing the agents into these two groups with specific subtask curriculums tailored to their roles, we aim to improve the overall team performance in the 5 vs 5 football game setting.
