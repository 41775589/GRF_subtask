**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football game, each player has a specific role to play within the team, such as goalkeeper, defenders, midfielders, and forwards. Therefore, we can group the agents based on these roles to design an effective subtask curriculum.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** Learn defensive skills and positioning

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** Learn offensive skills and scoring tactics

In football, defenders need to possess strong defensive skills such as tackling, marking, intercepting passes, and clearing the ball. They also need to understand their positioning on the field to prevent the opponent from scoring goals. Therefore, the training goal for Group 1 will focus on defensive skills and proper positioning in the game.

On the other hand, forwards are responsible for scoring goals, making strategic attacking moves, and creating goal-scoring opportunities. They need to be good at shooting, dribbling, passing, and making runs to get into goal-scoring positions. The training goal for Group 2 will concentrate on offensive skills and tactics to maximize goal-scoring opportunities and break through the opponent's defense.

By dividing the agents into these two groups and providing specific subtask curriculums, we can enhance their individual skills and overall team performance in the 5 vs 5 football game setting.
