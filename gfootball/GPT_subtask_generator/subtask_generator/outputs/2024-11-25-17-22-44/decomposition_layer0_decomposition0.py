**Analyse:**
In a football match, different players have specific roles based on their position on the field. For example, defenders focus on preventing the opposing team from scoring, while midfielders play a crucial role in transitioning the ball between defense and offense. Therefore, we can divide the five agents into two groups: defenders and midfielders.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** Learn defensive tactics and actions such as Sliding, Stop-Dribble, and Stop-Sprint, focusing on maintaining the defensive line, intercepting the ball, and blocking shots.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** Learn midfield actions and strategies including Short Pass, High Pass, and Dribble, concentrating on ball possession, creating attacking opportunities, and supporting both the defensive and offensive phases of the game.
