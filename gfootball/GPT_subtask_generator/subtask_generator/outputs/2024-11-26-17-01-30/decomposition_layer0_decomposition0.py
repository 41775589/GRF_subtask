**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football game, players are typically divided into different positions based on their roles and responsibilities, such as forwards, midfielders, and defenders. These positions require different skills and actions, which can be the basis for creating subtask groups.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** learn offensive actions such as Shot, Dribble, and Sprint. Players in this group will focus on attacking strategies, positioning, and scoring goals.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** learn defensive actions such as Sliding, Stop-Dribble, and Stop-Sprint. Players in this group will focus on defensive strategies, marking, intercepting passes, and stopping the opposing team's attacks.
