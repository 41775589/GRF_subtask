**Analyse:**
In a typical 5 vs 5 football game setting, each player often has specialized roles and must master certain skills to function effectively. Drawing from real-world football strategies, players may be categorized into two primary groups: offensive (attackers and midfielders focused on goalscoring and ball control) and defensive (defenders and goalkeepers focused on ball interception, defending, and field positioning). By dividing training tasks among these two groups, we can enhance focused learning on specific skills before integrating them in full game scenarios. The set of available agent actions includes shooting, passing in various forms, movement in multiple directions, and specialized actions like dribbling or sliding. This suggests a strategic division where one group focuses primarily on ball control and attacking maneuvers, and the other on defensive strategies and accurate passing.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** This group will focus on offensive tactics, specifically on improving dribbling to maintain ball possession, executing different types of shots (Shot, High Pass aimed at the goal) to increase scoring chances, and decision-making when to dribble or shoot depending on the game context. Skills in quick direction changes (Right, Left, Top, Bottom) are also crucial for outmaneuvering defenders.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** This group will concentrate on defensive skills and midfield control. Key objectives include learning effective use of Sliding to tackle and regain ball possession, mastering various passes (Short Pass, Long Pass) to maintain possession and safely advance the ball upfield, and positioning to intercept opponentsâ€™ passes (moving strategically in all directions). Additional training will involve learning when to Sprint for quick coverage or Stop-Sprint to conserve energy for sustained defense.
