**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football game, each player has various key roles within the game's dynamics, such as controlling the midfield, attacking, and defending. To effectively cover the primary aspects of football, it is essential to focus on ball control and field tactics, considering both offensive and defensive strategies. Breakdown of the groups can be oriented towards mastering techniques essential for ball handling and productivity in scoring (offense group), as well as understanding spatial awareness and opponent interception (defense group).

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** This group focuses on mastering essential ball control and play-making actions, particularly emphasizing actions like Dribble, Stop-Dribble, and Sprint. The aim is to increase proficiency in maintaining possession, maneuvering around opponents, and creating opportunities. Additionally, this group will work on improving passing accuracy with specific emphasis on precision in Short Pass and High Pass to effectively transfer the ball under pressure, setting up scoring opportunities or retaining possession under pressure.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** This group's objective is to learn defensive maneuvers and positioning, crucial for intercepting the ball and preventing goals. Training will focus on mastering defensive actions such as Sliding for tackling and commanding actions like Stop-Moving and Stop-Sprint for optimal positioning and energy conservation. Moreover, to build a counter-attacking strategy, this group will also practice Long Pass and High Pass skills to quickly transition from defense to attack, harnessing the ability to send the ball across long distances accurately.
