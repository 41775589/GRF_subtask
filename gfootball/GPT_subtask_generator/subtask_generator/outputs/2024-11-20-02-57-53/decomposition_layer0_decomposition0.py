**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football match setting, the dynamics can be fundamentally split between offensive and defensive play, with a crucial aspect being the transition between these phases, which includes controlling the midfield. Thus, effective strategy entails having a set of players focusing on attacking, another on defending, and a crucial component focusing on midfield control and transition game. Such a configuration encourages specialized learning and mastery of essential skills pertinent to each domain, maximizing overall team performance by enabling players to excel in specific roles.

Given this setup, one group can concentrate on offensive tactics, focusing on making goals and utilizing advanced ball handling skills, while the second group can hone defensive strategies, focusing on ball interception, tackling, and effective clearing. The midfield controlling group, important in linking the defense to the attack, will handle ball distribution and maintaining possession, ensuring fluid team movements.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** This group will focus on offensive maneuvers. The primary training goal will be to learn how to effectively utilize dribbling to bypass opponents, execute precise shots to score goals, and use different types of passes (Short Pass, High Pass, Long Pass) to maneuver around defensive setups. This group will train intensively in actions such as Shot, Dribble, and different passing tactics to maximize scoring opportunities.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** This group's focus will be on defense. The agents here will learn Sliding for tackling, Sprint and Stop-Sprint for quick repositioning and halting sudden sprints, respectively, and mastering the Do-Nothing and Stop-Moving actions for controlling their movement and conserving energy strategically. Their job will be to prevent the opponents from breaking through the defense line, intercept passes, and effectively clear the ball from danger zones.

**Group 3:**
**Number of agents:** 1
**Training goal:** Due to the smaller size, this group's sole agent will be trained as a midfielder tasked with maintaining ball control and orchestrating the play between offense and defense. Crucial skills will include all types of passes to distribute the ball effectively and Sprint/Stop-Sprint for rapid role shifts during transitions. The focus will be on mastering passing and movement to ensure the team retains control over the game's tempo and spatial configuration on the field.
