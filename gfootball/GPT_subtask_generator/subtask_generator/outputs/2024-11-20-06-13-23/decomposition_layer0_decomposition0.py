**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football setup, it's often useful to segment training responsibilities across offensive and defensive tasks, while also integrating the unique aspects of midfield play which involves both aspects. For efficient learning and specialization, one can divide players into offensive, midfield, and defensive groups. The different groups can focus on tasks that are more relevant to their roles on the field, such as attackers focusing on scoring, midfielders on controlling and transitioning the play, and defenders on preventing goals.

Given that each role on the football field comes with unique responsibilities and skills, splitting our agents into two groups—one focused on attacking and ball control, the other on defense and transition—helps to prioritize learning relevant skills. The actions available in our simulated environment that correspond to these roles include directional movements, passing, and specific actions like Dribbling or Sliding for offensive and defensive maneuvers respectively.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** The primary objective for this group is to master attacking skills with an emphasis on direct goal-scoring opportunities. This group should focus on maximizing the use of actions such as Shot for scoring goals and Dribble to navigate past defenders. The agents need to utilize the Sprint action to leverage speed in breaking through defensive lines, and practice Stop-Dribble to better control the play near the opponent's goal area.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** This group is focused on defensive strategies and midfield control, critical for breaking up opposition attacks and supporting their own team's offensive efforts. They should concentrate on learning Defensive actions like Sliding for tackling and using different Pass types (Short Pass, High Pass, Long Pass) to distribute the ball effectively and initiate counter-attacks. The agents in this group will also need to perfect movements in multiple directions to adjust their positioning both for attacking contributions and defensive recoveries. This group will also implement Stop-Moving and Stop-Sprint strategically to maintain formation and control pacing.
