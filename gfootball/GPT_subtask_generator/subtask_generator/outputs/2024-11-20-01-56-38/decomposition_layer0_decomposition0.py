**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football setup, the complexity of interactions and breadth of required skills mean that effective sub-task training should cover a range of focused roles and responsibilities, typically split between offensive and defensive duties, as well as specialized situations like set-pieces and high-pressure defenses. Additionally, considering the diversity in the available actions like passes, shots, dribbles, and tackles, a strategic division not only by role but also by action type can optimize learning. In this simulated setup, we could divide the agents into one group primarily focused on offensive strategies—enhancing attacking skills such as shooting and dribbling—and another group dedicated to defensive tasks, focusing on intercepting passes, tackling, and clearing the ball from dangerous areas.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** This group will focus on offensive maneuvers. The training will specifically tailor around maximizing goal-scoring opportunities through effective dribbling to bypass defenders, accurate shooting to convert chances into goals, and utilizing different types of passes (short and long) to navigate through tight defensive setups. This specialization will allow these agents to handle high-pressure situations where quick, decisive attacking actions are needed.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** This group is tasked with mastering the defensive aspect of the game. The primary focus will be on learning to intercept passes effectively, perform sliding tackles without conceding fouls, and clear the ball from dangerous areas. Additionally, this group will practice positioning to avoid offsides and handle emergency defensive actions such as defending against penalty kicks and performing goal-line clearances. This will ensure that the agents can maintain a solid defensive line and disrupt the opposing team's offensive strategies. 

This strategic division allows the agents to focus on specific sets of skills relevant to their roles in the team, which can expedite learning and lead to more coordinated team play during the full game scenarios.
