**Analyse:**
In a standard 5 vs 5 football match, it's effective to categorize player roles into ones more focused on maintaining possession and building play (midfielders) and those focused on finishing and scoring (strikers). Similarly, defensive positioning and ball recovery are critical, which typically are responsibilities of defenders. Hence, we can form two groups reflecting these aspects â€” one that prioritizes ball control and providing support in both offensive and defensive transitions, and another focused on scoring and direct attacking maneuvers.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** This group will focus on mastering skills essential for controlling the game tempo and maintaining possession. The primary activities would include mastering diverse passing techniques such as Short Pass, High Pass, and Long Pass, as well as improving their movement in all directions to develop strong positional play. Defensive actions like Sliding to regain possession and Sprinting to cover defensive or attacking transitions should also be emphasized, fostering a better understanding of when to shift from a walking pace to a sprint in game scenarios.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** The main focus for this group will be on attacking drills that lead to goal scoring. Actions such as Shot, Dribble, and Stop-Dribble will be the primary skills to harness. The ability to finish plays by accurately shooting from different positions on the field will be prioritized. They will also practice various dribbling maneuvers to evade defenders effectively. This group will train intensively on perfect alignment with the goalpost for more accurate shots and the efficient use of the Sprint action to exploit open spaces in the defense.
