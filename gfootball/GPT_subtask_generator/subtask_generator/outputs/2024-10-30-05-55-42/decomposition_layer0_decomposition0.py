**Analyse:**
In a typical football match, players are often categorized into different positions, each with its own set of responsibilities. For instance, defenders focus on protecting their own goal, while midfielders transition between offense and defense, and forwards aim to score goals. 
For the 5 vs 5 football game setting with 5 agents, we can divide the agents into two groups: one dedicated to defense and the other to offense. In this setup, the defending group can focus on stopping opponents from scoring, while the offensive group concentrates on tactics to score goals.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** learn defensive actions such as Sliding, Stop-Dribble, Stop-Moving, and Stop-Sprint, emphasizing blocking opponents' shots and preventing them from advancing towards the goal.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** master offensive actions like Shot, Dribble, Sprint, and various types of pass (Short Pass, High Pass, Long Pass) to enhance goal-scoring capabilities and create opportunities for scoring.
