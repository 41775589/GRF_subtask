**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football game setting, each player has a critical role that usually aligns with either offensive or defensive strategies—much like bigger standard football teams. We can utilize a division that focuses each group on specific aspects of play—ball control and movement, and positional discipline and interceptive actions. This educational division helps agents specialize in areas that are critical to the dynamics of a small team game, supporting more detailed and focused learning outcomes. Considering this, one group can concentrate on enhancing attacking strategies, primarily through improved dribbling and shooting, while another can work on defensive maneuvers and accurate passing to maintain possession and control over the game.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** This group will focus on offensive capabilities, particularly on improving dribbling and shooting skills. The agents in this group will aim to master movements that enhance their ability to control the ball in tight spaces, execute rapid direction changes (using movement directions like Top, Bottom, Left, Right, and their combinations), and to finalize attacks by learning when to choose between Shot types. This group will simulate various offensive scenarios to enhance their decision-making and technical skills in approaching the goal.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** The objective for this group is to develop strong defensive tactics and mastery in ball distribution under pressure. These agents will focus on learning to intercept the ball (using actions like Sliding), maintain formation, and master different types of passes (Short Pass, High Pass, and Long Pass) to effectively clear the ball from dangerous areas and set up counter-attacks. The agents will also practice Stop-Moving and Stop-Sprint commands to better control their pace and positioning, ensuring tighter defense against opposing attacks.
