**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football game, the challenge lies in mastering both offensive and defensive skills while ensuring effective team coordination. Therefore, we can divide the training into two main sub-tasks: one focusing on offensive strategies and the other on defensive techniques. This division allows specific skill development tailored to distinct aspects of the game, which are crucial for a holistic team performance. Given the action set available, offensive training would emphasize on dribbling, shooting, and passing, while defensive training would focus on positioning, sliding, and intercepting passes. This structured approach helps in building a balanced team with designated expertise in both attacking and defending situations.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** Focus on developing offensive skills. This includes mastering dribbling to better control and maneuver the ball against opponents, shooting to efficiently score goals, and advanced passing techniques (Short Pass, High Pass, Long Pass) to maintain possession and create scoring opportunities. These agents will effectively act as forwards and midfielders, taking the initiative in attacking plays.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** Concentrate on defensive capabilities. This group will work on positioning to better block opponent movements and shots, perfecting the sliding tackle to dispossess opponents without committing fouls, and learning to intercept passes to disrupt the opposing team's strategies. These agents will function primarily as defenders, focusing on securing the defensive line and initiating counterattacks through smart positioning and ball recovery.
