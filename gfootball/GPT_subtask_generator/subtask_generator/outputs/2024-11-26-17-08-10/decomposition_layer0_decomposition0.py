**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football game, the key aspects can be split into ball control and tactical play. Ball control includes maintaining possession, dribbling, and accurate passing or shooting, which are fundamental to mounting offensive plays. Tactical play involves strategic movement, defensive positioning, and anticipating the opponent's movements. Therefore, the five players can be divided into two groups: one focusing on ball control and the second on tactical play, including defensive maneuvers and strategic positioning.

Given the structure of the game and the importance of both offense and defense in such a compact team format, the ball control group will consist of 2 players. These players will focus on dribbling, passing, and shooting. The tactical play group will consist of 3 players, dealing primarily with defensive positioning, intercepting passes, and coordinating movements to block the opponent's strategy.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** Master ball control skills to enhance possession and create opportunities for scoring. Focus on improving dribbling to evade opponents, mastering both short and long passes to retain possession under pressure, and enhancing shooting skills to increase goal-scoring opportunities. Practice drills should involve targeted passing exercises, dribbling through cones, and precision shooting at the goal from various distances to adapt to rapid on-field decision-making.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** Develop tactical awareness and defensive skills to disrupt the opposing team's attacks and regain control of the ball. Focus on reading the game and predicting opponents' actions, positioning to intercept passes, and cooperative defensive strategies to cover more field area efficiently. Training should emphasize spatial awareness drills, coordination exercises for maintaining formation integrity, and practice on tackling (sliding) to safely reclaim the ball. Further, agents should be skilled in executing quick counter-attacks once possession is regained, using high or long passes to transition from defense to offense swiftly.
