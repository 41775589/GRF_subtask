**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football game, each player has a specific role to play, such as defenders, midfielders, and forwards. Thus, dividing the agents into groups based on these positions can be beneficial for subtask curriculum learning.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** Focus on midfield actions
- In football, midfielders play a crucial role in linking defense and attack, controlling possession, and distributing the ball effectively. Therefore, the training goal for this group could include actions like Short Pass, High Pass, Long Pass, Stop-Dribble, and Sprint to enhance their ability to create plays and switch between offensive and defensive phases.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** Emphasize defensive actions
- Defenders are responsible for preventing the opposing team from scoring, tackling opponents, and regaining possession. Hence, the training goal for this group can concentrate on actions like Sliding, Stop-Moving, Stop-Sprint, and coordinating defensive strategies to improve their capacity to protect the goal and support the midfielders in transitioning the ball to the attackers.
