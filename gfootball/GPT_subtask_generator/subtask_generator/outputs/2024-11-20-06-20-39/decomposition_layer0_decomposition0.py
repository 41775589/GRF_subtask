**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football game, the complexity of each player's role is often high due to the limited number of players and the dynamic nature of the game. Players need to excel in multiple facets: ball handling, positional awareness, and team coordination. To effectively train the agents, we can structure the groups based on role specialization: one group focuses on ball control skills, which includes advancing the ball through dribbling or making tactical plays; the other group focuses on strategic positioning and defense, which involves intercepting passes and maintaining formation. This not only simplifies the learning process by concentrating on specific sets of tasks but also reflects the typical division of training concepts in real-world football.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** The first group is primarily focused on ball control and offensive plays. This group will learn to dribble effectively to retain possession and navigate through opponents, execute precise shots on goal, and make decisive passes (short and long). Training will emphasize on actions such as Dribble, Stop-Dribble, Shot, Short Pass, and Long Pass. Practices should include scenarios of advancing the ball from midfield to the attacking third and finishing.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** The second group is tasked with defensive skills and strategic team positioning. These agents will concentrate on actions critical for defense and tactical movement, including Sliding for tackling, Sprint for quick repositioning, and various moving directions to maintain an optimal formation and cover potential threats. They should also practice interception skills using High Passes and positional discipline to handle scenarios like corner and goal kicks defense, and managing offside traps.
