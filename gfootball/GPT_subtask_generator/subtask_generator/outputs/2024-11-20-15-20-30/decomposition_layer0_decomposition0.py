**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football game, the synergy between players and understanding of different facets of gameplay is essential for success. Based on the rules and environmental settings, the main task can be split into technical skill development and tactical understanding. Technical skills include ball handling, precise shooting, and executing different types of passes. Tactical understanding involves positioning, movement without the ball, and defensive strategies. Therefore, one group can focus on improving technical skills related to ball control and offense, while the other can focus on tactical positioning and defense.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** This group's primary objective is to master individual technical skills. This includes dribbling to navigate through opponents, precision in shooting to effectively score goals, and practicing different passing techniques (Short Pass, High Pass, Long Pass) to maintain possession and create scoring opportunities. The specific focus will be on actions such as Shot, Dribble, Stop-Dribble, and all types of passes.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** The focus for this group is on tactical understanding and defensive maneuvers. They will learn how to position themselves optimally on the field, move efficiently to cover more ground, and intercept or challenge opponents. This group will particularly focus on actions such as moving in all directions, Sliding (for tackling), Sprint and Stop-Sprint (for quick reaction and movement), and Stop-Moving (to maintain strategic positions). Defensive coordination and learning when to engage in Sliding tackles or when to simply contain opponents by strategic positioning will be key here.
