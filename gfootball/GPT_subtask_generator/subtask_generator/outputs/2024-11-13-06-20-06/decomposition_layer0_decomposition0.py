**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football game, each player has specific roles based on their positions on the field. Typically, there are attacking players responsible for scoring goals and defending players focused on preventing the other team from scoring. Therefore, our five agents can be divided into attacking players and defending players to create two groups.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** learn attacking actions such as Shot, Dribble, and Sprint. Attacking players need to be skilled at scoring goals, dribbling past defenders, and sprinting towards the opponent's goal, so the training goal for this group will focus on mastering these actions.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** learn defensive actions such as Sliding, Stop-Dribble, and Stop-Moving. Defending players play a crucial role in stopping the opponent's attacks, so the training goal for this group will concentrate on actions that help in defense, such as sliding tackles, stopping dribblers, and intercepting passes.
