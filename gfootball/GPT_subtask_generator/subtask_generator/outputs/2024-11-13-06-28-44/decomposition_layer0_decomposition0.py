**Analyse:**
In a football match, players have different roles and responsibilities based on their position on the field. For example, defenders are responsible for stopping the opposing team from scoring, while midfielders are tasked with both attacking and defending. Therefore, in a 5 vs 5 football game, we can divide the five agents into two groups based on their roles: one group for offensive players and one group for defensive players. 

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** Develop offensive skills and actions such as Shot, Dribble, and Pass to create scoring opportunities.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** Focus on defensive skills and actions such as Sliding, Tackling, and Interception to prevent the opposing team from scoring.
