**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football game setting, it is crucial for the team to have a well-coordinated defense and offense to succeed. Therefore, we can divide the 5 agents into two groups: one focused on defense and the other focused on offense.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** Learn defensive actions, such as marking opponents, intercepting passes, and clearing the ball effectively. This group should focus on actions like Sliding, Stop-Dribble, and Stop-Sprint that are essential for defense.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** Learn offensive actions, such as passing, dribbling, and shooting. This group should focus on actions like Short Pass, High Pass, Long Pass, Dribble, and Shot that are vital for creating goal-scoring opportunities.
