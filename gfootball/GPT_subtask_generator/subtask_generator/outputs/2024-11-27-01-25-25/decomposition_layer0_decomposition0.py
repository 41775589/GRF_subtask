**Analyse:**
To effectively train the agents in a 5 vs 5 football game setting, one plausible strategy is to focus on two fundamental aspects of football: possession management (including passing and retaining the ball) and goal-scoring opportunities (including attacking the opponent's goal). By dividing the five agents into two groups, we can focus on specialized training that hones specific skills, which is often more efficient than attempting to train all skills simultaneously. The agents can later integrate their learned behaviors during full game simulations.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** This group will focus on developing skills related to possession management. This includes mastering tasks such as maintaining control of the ball, short and long passes, and learning effective dribbling techniques to evade opponents. Key actions for this group will be Short Pass, Long Pass, Dribble, Stop-Dribble, and maintaining directional movements to create space and options for progression on the pitch.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** This group will concentrate on converting possessions into goal-scoring opportunities. They will focus on actions such as positioning for shots, making decisive runs towards the goal, and executing different types of shots based on the situation. Key actions will include Shot, High Pass (for crossing situations), Sprint to break away from defenders, and specific directional movements like moving to Top-Right or Bottom-Right to align for goal attempts.
