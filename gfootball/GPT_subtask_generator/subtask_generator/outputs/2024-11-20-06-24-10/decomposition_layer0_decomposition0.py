**Analyse:**
In a standard 5 vs 5 football game, dividing the tasks into attacking and defensive roles isn’t just a strategy; it’s essential for covering the game's fundamental aspects efficiently. However, beyond attacking and defending, midfield control – including transitioning from defense to offense and vice versa – is crucial and often dictates the flow of the game. For this reason, it would be beneficial to separate the team into a group focused on transitional play and another on strategic positioning, which includes both defending and finishing.

Our approach here focuses not just on the basic roles but on the intricacies of player movement and decision-making. Group 1 will handle transitional plays which often requires quick, accurate passes and strong decision-making to switch from defense to attack. Group 2, on the other hand, will focus on optimizing positioning, which is pivotal both in creating offensive opportunities and reducing defensive risks.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** This group will focus on mastering the transitional aspect of the game. The primary training goals for these agents will include mastering various passing techniques (Short Pass, High Pass, Long Pass) to maintain possession and effectively switch the play from defense to attack. These agents will also practice Dribble to navigate through tight spaces and Stop-Moving and Stop-Sprint actions to regulate game pace and create setups for plays.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** Agents in this group will concentrate on critical positioning strategies necessary for both defense and attack. They will learn to use strategic movements (moving in all directions, Sprint, and Stop-Sprint) to position themselves optimally on the field, whether to intercept a pass defensively or to make themselves available for a pass in an offensive setup. Furthermore, they will practice Shot to finish scoring opportunities and Sliding to disrupt opponent's plays defensively. This group will also integrate skills like Do-Nothing at strategic moments to conserve energy or mislead opponents about their next move.
