**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football setting, each player roles and position-specific skills are crucial. To optimize performance, we can delineate the players into two basic functions: offense and midfield-defense. Offensive players focus on scoring and applying pressure in the opponent's half, while midfielders and defenders are tasked with controlling the game flow, possession, and defending. 

Offensive training would mainly target shooting and dribbling capabilities, essential for attacking strategies. On the other hand, midfield-defenders would focus on mastering ball distribution and positioning, vital for both transitioning the ball from defense to offense and stopping the opposition's advances.

Given the complexity and spatial nature of the game, agents in this setup would need to practice coordinated actions and spatial awareness, enhancing teamwork and individual decision-making to adapt dynamically to game situations.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** Focused on developing offensive strategies including mastering accurate shooting, effective dribbling to evade opponents, and practicing different pass types (long and high passes) to break defensive lines.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** Emphasis on defensive and midfield control, enhancing skills such as intercepting passes (utilizing sliding and movement stops), mastering short and quick passing to maintain possession, and practicing positional awareness to effectively support both defense and attack transitions.
