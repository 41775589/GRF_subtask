**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football match, it's important to have a specialized focus on both attacking and defensive tactics, along with effective ball control and distribution. In real-world football training, it is common for players to be trained in specific roles that align with their positions and responsibilities during a match. This strategy not only strengthens the individual capabilities of each player but also enhances their ability to function cohesively as part of a unit. Given the complexity of interactions in a football game, effectively managing ball possession and transitioning between defense and attack are crucial. Thus, we can identify clear roles and corresponding subtasks: (1) ball handlers who specialize in possession and delivering accurate passes, and (2) goal-oriented attackers whose main objective is to score.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** Focus on ball control, passing, and initiating plays. The specific actions this group should master include Short Pass, High Pass, High Dribble, and Stop-Dribble. Their training will concentrate on maintaining possession under pressure, accurately distributing the ball to forward players, and supporting transitions from defense to attack.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** Focus on attacking and finishing. The key actions for this group will include Shot, Sprint, Sliding, and Dribble aimed toward goal-facing maneuvers. This group will work on offensive positioning, quick sprints to beat the defensive line, effective shooting from various positions, and dribbling skills to evade defenders in one-on-one situations. This groupâ€™s efficiency in completing attacks will be vital for scoring during matches.

This specialized training approach allows for targeted skill development in areas critical to gameplay success, fostering proficiency in specific tasks crucial to the team's overall strategy.
