**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football game setting, it is essential to have a balanced team with players assigned specific roles, such as attackers, midfielders, and defenders. Therefore, we can divide the 5 agents into two groups: one group focused on attacking actions and one group focused on defensive actions.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** Focus on offensive actions such as Shot, Dribble, and Passing. These agents will learn how to coordinate attacks, create scoring opportunities, and improve their decision-making in offensive situations.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** Concentrate on defensive actions such as Tackling, Intercepting, and Marking. These agents will learn how to work together to defend against opponent attacks, maintain proper positioning, and prevent scoring opportunities.

By dividing the agents into specific groups with tailored subtask curriculums, we can enhance the overall performance of the team in a 5 vs 5 football game setting.
