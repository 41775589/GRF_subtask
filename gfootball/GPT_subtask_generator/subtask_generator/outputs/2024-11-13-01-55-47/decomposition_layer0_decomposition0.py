**Analyse:**
In a football match, players are typically divided into attacking and defending roles. Each group has specific responsibilities and actions they need to learn to perform well collectively. In a 5 vs 5 football game setting, dividing the agents into groups with distinct training goals can provide a structured approach to learning.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** Learn offensive actions such as Shot, Sliding, and Dribble. Players in this group should focus on scoring goals and creating attacking opportunities. These actions require precision and decision-making in the final third of the pitch. By mastering these skills, the agents will become proficient in offensive strategies and goal scoring.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** Learn defensive actions such as Sliding, Intercepting, and Marking. Players in this group should focus on preventing the opposition from scoring and maintaining defensive shape. Defensive actions play a crucial role in protecting the goal and regaining possession. By mastering these defensive skills, the agents will become reliable defenders and contribute to the team's overall defensive strategy.
