**Analyse:**
In a standard 5 vs 5 football game, players need to excel in specific roles associated with either controlling the game (through maintaining possession and accurate passing) or converting control into scoring opportunities (through shooting and tactical positioning). To harness this strategy effectively, I suggest decomposing the main task into two primary groups: one focused on ball control and possession, and another on offensive execution or goal-scoring. This subdivision not only mimics real-world football trainings, focusing on specialized skills but also allows tailored learning objectives that can enhance the overall team performance through focused expertise development in multi-agent reinforcement learning. 

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** Mastering ball control and development of passing accuracy. This group will focus on maintaining possession by effectively using the dribble, executing short and long passes, and responding defensively when required. Key actions to train include Dribble, Stop-Dribble, Short Pass, Long Pass, and defensive maneuvres like Sliding.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** Focused on creating and exploiting scoring opportunities. Agents in this group should learn to optimally position themselves, decide when to engage in sprints to outmaneuver opponents, and perform effective shooting. Primary actions include Shot, Sprint, Stop-Sprint, High Pass (for crosses), and mastering the timing for offensive moves.
