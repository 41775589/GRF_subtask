**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football game setting, it is essential to have a balanced team with players having different roles and responsibilities. Therefore, we can divide the five agents into two groups based on the primary functions in a football game - attacking and defending.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** Focus on attacking actions such as Shot, Dribble, and High Pass. These actions are crucial for creating scoring opportunities and advancing the ball towards the opponent's goal.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** Concentrate on defensive actions like Sliding, Intercepting, and Positioning. These actions are important for stopping the opponent's attacks and protecting the team's own goal.

By dividing the agents into an attacking group and a defending group, we can create a subtask curriculum that helps each group focus on specific skills and strategies to improve their performance in the main task of playing a 5 vs 5 football game.
