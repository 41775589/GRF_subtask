**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football game, the dynamics can be broadly split into two main functional areas: ball handling (including dribbling and shooting) and game strategy (including positioning, passing, and set-piece execution). Given this division, for effective learning and specialization, we can form two groups where one focuses on individual skills primarily around managing the ball in offensive scenarios, and the other focuses on strategic play which encompasses defensive positioning, passing accuracy, and executing set-pieces efficiently. By doing this, not only do we mimic real-world football training regimes where players often focus on specific skill sets but also simplify the learning objectives for each group leading to potentially better and faster learning outcomes.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** Mastering individual ball control and offensive tactics. This group will focus on actions like Dribble, Stop-Dribble, Shot, and Sprint. The rationale is to develop the proficiency of these two agents in situations that require direct interaction with the ball to either navigate through defenders or take decisive shots on goal. The emphasis will be on agility with the ball, precise shooting, and quick changes in speed.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** Developing team strategic play and defensive coherence. This group will be tasked with mastering movements related to positioning (moving in different directions to maintain formation or adjust to the game's circumstances), performing different types of passes (Short Pass, High Pass, Long Pass) to maintain possession under pressure, and executing set-pieces like corner kicks and penalty kicks. The focus will also include learning to transition from attacking to defensive stances, thus learning when to Stop-Sprint, Stop-Moving, or enact strategic Sliding tackles to regain ball control.
