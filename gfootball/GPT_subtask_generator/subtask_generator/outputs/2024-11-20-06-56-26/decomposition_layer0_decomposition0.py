**Analyse:**
To effectively train agents for a 5 vs 5 football game, we can look into specific roles that mimic real-life football strategies. These roles include attackers responsible for scoring goals and midfielders/defenders who manage both defense and supporting the forward movement of the ball. This distribution allows for specialized training focussing on offensive skills in one group, and defensive plus transitional play in the other. The formation will loosely resemble real-world tactical setups, aiding in positional play and decision-making under different game scenarios.

Given the diversity of actions available (e.g., passing, shooting, moving in multiple directions), we can enhance the learning curves by dedicating focus areas. Attackers will be trained extensively on finishing techniques and advanced dribbling, whereas midfielders and defenders will work on ball distribution, positioning, and tackling.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** Master offensive strategies including advanced dribbling maneuvers like Dribble, Stop-Dribble, precision in Shooting from different angles, and decision-making on when to perform a Shot versus a pass. This groupâ€™s focus will sharpen these skills, particularly making quick breakthroughs and efficient shot execution to maximize scoring chances.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** Focus on defensive actions, ball recovery, and supportive transitional play. Training includes mastering the Sliding for tackles, various Passing types (Short Pass, High Pass, Long Pass) to maintain possession and accurately distribute the ball under pressure. Additional focus includes strategic movement (all directional moves including Sprint and Stop-Sprint) to form a robust defensive line and support attacks when possession is regained. This group will also practice scenarios to effectively switch from defense to attack, improving overall team dynamics.
