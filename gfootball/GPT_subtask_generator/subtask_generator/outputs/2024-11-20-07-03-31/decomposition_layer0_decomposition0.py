**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football game, team dynamics and individual skill sets play pivotal roles. Considering real-world football training, a common division among player roles includes those who focus on building gameplay (midfield roles) and others who concentrate on terminating offensive plays or initiating defense (forward and defensive roles). This segmentation allows for specialized training, enhancing players' abilities in specific scenarios. In the case of multi-agent learning, we can assign two key subtasks: one focusing on strategic possession and playmaking, crucial in midfield roles, and the other focusing on both scoring and defensive actions, which are essential in forward and defensive scenarios.

Given this, we can divide our 5 agents into two groups:
1. Agents focusing on maintaining possession, controlling the game pace, accurate passing, and transitions from defense to attack.
2. Agents focusing on goal-oriented tasks such as scoring and effective defense including blocking and sliding tackles, besides quick transitions to counterattack strategies when needed.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** This group will focus on the fundamental aspects of possession and playmaking. The key tasks will include mastering complex passing strategies (Short Pass, High Pass, Long Pass), effective movement across the field to maintain ball possession, and tactical repositioning (maneuvering directions). The training should also include Sprint and Stop-Sprint actions to manage the game tempo, aimed at creating opportunities and opening spaces.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** This group will concentrate on concluding plays efficiently through scoring and robust defending. Their tasks will include mastering the Shot action, Sliding for defensive maneuvers, and quick decision-making for transitions into counterattacks. A focus on aggressive but controlled actions like Dribble and Sprint will be crucial. Defensive strategies like positioning to tackle possible handballs and learning the intricacies of defensive movements (Top, Bottom, Left, Right, etc.) to reduce opponent scoring chances are integral as well.
