**Analyse:**
In a typical 5 vs 5 football game, strategic division of tasks among players is crucial for effective team performance. To enhance learning efficiency in such a simulated environment, grouping agents into specialized roles can mimic real-world football strategies, such as attackers who concentrate on scoring and midfielders who control the game flow and support defense. Therefore, we will organize our agents into two groups: one focusing on attacking (scoring) and another on midfield actions, which include both offensive and defensive skills.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** This group will focus on skills related to offensive play. The primary objectives include mastering advanced dribbling techniques to evade opponents, optimizing shot accuracy and decision-making when near the goal, and effectively using different types of passes (Short Pass, High Pass) to maintain possession and create scoring opportunities. Specific actions to learn are Shot, Dribble, Stop-Dribble, and the various directional movements to position themselves optimally in attack situations.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** This group's aim is to control the midfield, which acts as a bridge between defense and attack. These agents will specialize in gaining and maintaining ball possession, conducting play transitions, and supporting the defensive line when necessary. Key learning outcomes include mastering various passing techniques to distribute the ball under different match scenarios, learning when to Sprint or Stop-Sprint to adapt to changing game dynamics, and developing defensive actions like Sliding to regain control during opponent attacks. The primary actions to focus on are Short Pass, High Pass, Long Pass, Sprint, Stop-Sprint, and Sliding. This will ensure effective support to both the defensive and offensive players, maintaining balance in team dynamics.
