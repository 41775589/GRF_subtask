**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football game setting, each player has a specific role and position on the field. Players need to work together as a team to attack, defend, and score goals. Therefore, we can divide the 5 agents into two groups based on their roles in the game: attacking players and defending players.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** Focus on attacking actions such as Shot, Dribble, and High Pass. These actions are crucial for creating scoring opportunities and finishing goals. By training the agents in these attacking actions, they will learn to work together effectively to penetrate the opponent's defense and score goals.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** Concentrate on defending actions such as Sliding, Intercept, and Tackling. Defending players play a vital role in stopping the opponent's attacks, regaining possession of the ball, and supporting the team's overall defensive strategy. By training the agents in these defensive actions, they will learn how to maintain a strong defensive line, block shots, and prevent the opposing team from scoring.
