**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football game setting, the main task involves coordination between all five agents on each team to achieve both offensive and defensive success. Therefore, we can divide the five agents into two groups based on their roles on the field: attackers and defenders.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** The training goal for this group is to focus on offensive actions such as Shot, Dribble, and Passing. Since attackers are responsible for scoring goals, it is crucial for them to master these skills for effective gameplay. Additionally, other actions like Sprint and Long Pass can be included to enhance their attacking capabilities and strategic decision-making in different game situations.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** The training goal for this group is to focus on defensive actions and positioning, including actions like Sliding, Marking, and Intercepting. Defenders play a crucial role in preventing the opposing team from scoring goals, therefore mastering these defensive actions and understanding proper defensive positioning is essential for the success of the team. Additionally, actions like Tackling and Clearing can be included to improve their defensive skills and decision-making under pressure.
