**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football game, the agents need to work together to achieve the common goal of scoring and preventing goals. We can divide the 5 agents into two groups based on their roles on the field: attackers and defenders. Attackers focus on scoring goals, while defenders focus on preventing the opponent from scoring.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** learn the offensive actions, such as Shot, Dribble, and Sprint. These actions are crucial for attackers to create scoring opportunities and successfully score goals.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** learn the defensive actions, such as Sliding, Stop-Dribble, and Stop-Sprint. These actions are important for defenders to stop the opponent's attacks and protect their own goal effectively.
