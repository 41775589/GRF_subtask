**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football game setting, it is crucial to have a good balance between offense and defense. Therefore, we can divide the 5 agents into one group responsible for offense and one group responsible for defense. This grouping will help in achieving a coordinated and strategic gameplay.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** Since offense involves scoring goals and creating opportunities to score, the training goal for this group will focus on actions like Shot, Dribble, and Passing to create scoring chances. These agents will learn how to effectively navigate through the field, take shots on goal, and pass the ball to create goal-scoring opportunities.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** Defense is essential to prevent the opponent from scoring goals. Therefore, the training goal for this group will focus on actions like Tackling, Intercepting, and Positioning to stop the opponent's attacks and regain possession of the ball. These agents will learn how to work together to defend against the opponent's offense and disrupt their gameplay.
