**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football game, the complexity is high due to the simultaneous need for attacking strategies and defensive stability. To effectively cover these areas, dividing the team into two groups focused on specific elements of the game mirrors real-world tactics where players specialize in either offensive or defensive roles. Specifically, one group will concentrate on attacking through coordinated movements and finishing, while the other focuses on defensive positioning, intercepting, and ball recovery.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** Focus on developing advanced offensive skills. This group's primary objective is to master the skills of dribbling to evade opponents, executing precise shots towards the goal, and performing tricky passes like the Long Pass to break through defensive lines. They should also practice Sprint to quickly take advantage of open spaces or break away from defenders.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** This group will concentrate on defensive and midfield control skills. The agents will learn to effectively use Sliding to dispossess opponents, Short Pass and High Pass for clearances and building attacks from the back. Additionally, they will practice Stop-Moving and Stop-Sprint to maintain formation and reduce space for opponents. They should also be trained in strategic positioning to intercept passes and regain control of the ball during transitions.
