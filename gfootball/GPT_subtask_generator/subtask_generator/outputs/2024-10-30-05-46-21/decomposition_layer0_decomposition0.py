**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football game, each player has a specific role on the field. The positions typically include a goalkeeper, defenders, midfielders, and forwards. To effectively train the agents in the main task, we can divide them into two groups based on these traditional football positions.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** learn defensive actions, such as positioning, tackling, intercepting, and marking opponents. Emphasize actions like Stop-Dribble, Sprint, Stop-Moving for defensive maneuvers.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** focus on offensive actions, such as passing, shooting, dribbling, and creating goal-scoring opportunities. Highlight actions like Short Pass, High Pass, Long Pass, Shot, and Dribble for offensive plays.
