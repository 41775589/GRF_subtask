**Analyse:**
A 5 vs 5 football game environment provides a compact yet complex setup where each agent must learn specialized skills to perform effectively. In such a setup, it is beneficial to segment the five players into two groups focusing on specific aspects of play: ball control and tactical movement. Ball control involves skills primarily related to handling the ball directly and influencing the immediate play, such as dribbling or shooting. On the other hand, tactical movement includes positioning, passing, and strategic plays necessary to set up scoring opportunities or defend effectively.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** This group's primary focus will be on mastering ball control. The agents here will concentrate on actions such as Dribble, Stop-Dribble, Shot, and Sprint. These skills are crucial for offense in creating scoring opportunities and maintaining possession under pressure. Training will involve scenarios such as taking the ball from midfield into the opposition's penalty area, shooting from various angles, and maintaining control of the ball while navigating through defenders.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** This group will focus on tactical movement and teamwork. The key actions for this group will be movement in various directions, Short Pass, High Pass, Long Pass, and positional tactics like Stop-Moving and Stop-Sprint to refine their positioning. The training scenarios include building plays from the back, distributing the ball under pressure, and positional awareness to cover offensive threats or support offensive plays effectively. This groupâ€™s ability to position themselves and pass accurately is vital for both defending and setting up goals.
