**Analyse:**
In football, players are typically divided into different positions, such as forwards, midfielders, and defenders, each with specific roles and responsibilities in the game. For a 5 vs 5 football game, it is essential to have a balance between attacking and defending strategies. Therefore, dividing the agents into attackers and defenders could be a reasonable approach.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** learn attacking actions, such as Shot, Dribble, and Passing

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** learn defensive actions, such as Tackling, Interceptions, and Clearances
