**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football game, it is important to have a balanced team with players who can both defend and attack effectively. Therefore, we can divide the 5 agents into one group of defensive players and one group of offensive players, making the group number 2.
Defensive players need to focus on actions like Sliding, Tackling, and Intercepting to prevent the opponents from scoring, while offensive players need to focus on actions like Dribbling, Passing, and Shooting to create scoring opportunities.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** learn defensive actions, Sliding, Tackling, and Intercepting

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** learn offensive actions, Dribbling, Passing, and Shooting
