**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football game setting, the players need to work collaboratively to achieve both offensive and defensive goals. Therefore, we can divide the agents into one group responsible for offense and one group responsible for defense, making the group number 2.

Since defense is crucial for maintaining control of the game, the first group will consist of 2 defensive players, and the second group will consist of 3 offensive players.

Considering the actions available to the agents in the football game setting, defensive players need to focus on actions like Sliding, Stop-Dribble, Stop-Moving to intercept opponents and protect their goal. On the other hand, offensive players need to focus on actions like Short Pass, High Pass, and Shot to advance towards the opponent's goal.

Thus, the subtasks could be:

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** learn defensive actions, Sliding, Stop-Dribble, Stop-Moving

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** learn offensive actions, Short Pass, High Pass, Shot
