**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football game setting, players are typically divided into attackers and defenders. Attackers focus on scoring goals, while defenders focus on preventing the opposition from scoring. With this in mind, we can create two groups based on these roles.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** Enhance attacking skills such as Shot, Dribble, and Long Pass. These actions are crucial for creating goal-scoring opportunities and taking advantage of the opponents' defensive weaknesses.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** Improve defensive skills such as Sliding, Intercepting, and Clearing the ball. These actions are essential for stopping the opposing team from scoring and maintaining possession to support the attackers.
