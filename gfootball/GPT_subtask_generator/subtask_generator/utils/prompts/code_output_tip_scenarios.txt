The reply should be a scenario setting function.
Your scenario setting function should only use the configurations used in the examples.
Make sure your function name is "def build_scenario(builder)" and follows the structure of the examples.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".
Importantly:
1. When writing inputs to builder.AddPlayer() function, do not add any prefix (e.g., Role.) to variables like e_PlayerRole_** (e.g., e_PlayerRole_GK), as this will cause the code to fail.
2. Here are all the roles that you can select when adding a player in a team:
    e_PlayerRole_GK: Goalkeeper
    e_PlayerRole_CB: Centre Back
    e_PlayerRole_LB: Left Back
    e_PlayerRole_RB: Right Back
    e_PlayerRole_DM: Defensive Midfielder
    e_PlayerRole_CM: Centre Midfielder
    e_PlayerRole_LM: Left Midfielder
    e_PlayerRole_RM: Right Midfielder
    e_PlayerRole_AM: Attacking Midfielder
    e_PlayerRole_CF: Centre Forward
3. No matter how many players each team has (even if there is only one), make sure each team has one and only one Goalkeeper (e_PlayerRole_GK), or the code will not function properly.
