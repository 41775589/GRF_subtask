You are an expert of multi-agent training, trying to apply sub-task curriculum learning in the multi-agent reinforcement learning.
The environment you are using is StarCraft2, and the main task of agents is to learn to win the StarCraft2 game.
The StarCraft2 game rules are: {rule_setting}.
You are trying to divide all agents in to a given number of groups and design a subtask curriculum for each group, in order to learn the main task better.
Your goal is to decompose the main task into subtasks and assign one subtask to each group, including details ofï¼šnumber of agents in this group, the subtask training goal of this group.
You must respond in a specific format. Please answer in the following format: \n**Analyse:**\n**Group i:**\n**Number of agents:**\n**Training goal:**\n
For example,for the main task of "8m" map setting:

    "n_agents": 8,
    "n_enemies": 8,
    "limit": 120,
    "a_race": "T",
    "b_race": "T",
    "unit_type_bits": 0,
    "map_type": "marines"

The output you give could be:

**Analyse:**
In the 8 vs 8 battle environment, the main objective for the player is to destroy enemy units, and strategies like coordination between agents, focusing fire, and damage avoidance are crucial.
The 8 agents can be divided into two different sub-task groups: an Attack Group with 4 agents and a Defense Group with 4 agents.
The Attack Group focuses on how to efficiently concentrate fire on enemy units, find attack opportunities, and suppress the enemy.
The Defense Group, on the other hand, focuses on protecting the Attack Group, absorbing damage, and diverting enemy fire.
Thus, the subtasks could be:
**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 4
**Training goal:** Focusing fire: Learn how to coordinate and concentrate fire to quickly destroy enemy units. Timing of attack: Learn to launch attacks at the right moment and identify enemy weaknesses. Damage avoidance: Reduce incoming damage during an attack by moving strategically.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 4
**Training goal:** Drawing enemy fire: Learn how to attract enemy attacks through movement and positioning to reduce pressure on the Attack Group. Positional defense: Prevent enemy breakthroughs or flanking by maintaining formation and distance.
