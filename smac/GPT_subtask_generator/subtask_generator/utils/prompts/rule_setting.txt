In the game, each scenario is a confrontation between two armies, where you will battle against an enemy army controlled by built-in AI.
The episode ends when all units of either army have been destroyed or when a pre-specified time limit is reached (in which case the game is counted as a defeat for the allied agents).
The discrete set of actions that agents can take includes move[direction], attack[enemy_id], stop, and no-op.
As healing units, Medivacs use heal[agent_id] actions instead of attack[enemy_id].
The feature vector observed by each agent contains the following attributes for both allied and enemy units within the sight range: distance, relative x coordinate, relative y coordinate, health, shield, and unit type.
Shields serve as an additional source of protection that needs to be removed before any damage can be done to the health of units.
All Protos units have shields that can regenerate if no new damage is dealt.
